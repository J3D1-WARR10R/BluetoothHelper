# BluetoothHelper
Tested with the HC-05 board

Created for a summer school class (EE47 @ Stanford) because Apple's main bluetooth framework, CoreBluetooth, only supports the 4.0 standard, which the HC-05 board does not. It requires that you know your bluetooth board's address which is easy to find. 

I needed a way to send a message from an OS X app to my Arduino which is why the class is "light" on content. It successfully fulfilled this goal and now allows me to easily send data from my computer for any future projects.
